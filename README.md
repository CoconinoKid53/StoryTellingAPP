# StoryTellingAPP
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a method of teaching small children basic moral practices through story telling. The project is a web app utilizing React and Google Firestore. Users entering the web app are met with a main menu which directs to the stories. Each story contains navigation back to the story selection page, as well as options to go back to a previous page in the story. Pictures are also provided, which are loaded in through Google Firestore's storage. Page navigation is handled through React Branch, and content is loaded through a letter/number code system, which will load information from Firestore documents with the same name. Currently, the web app contains 4 stories, but the option for more is available.

## Future Work
* More stories can be added to further fill out the web app
* Currently, the email form is a dummy, and does not actually send any messages. This could be changed to actually send emails to developers
* We could add a section to contain a small write up at the end in which users would write what lessons they learned through the experience
